## What is NODE
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en) (or more formally Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment 
that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. 

The runtime is intended for use **outside of a browser context** (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS). 
As such, the environment **omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries**.

$ cd demo-express
